Codex Usage Dock is a local Windows extension for PowerToys Command Palette. It displays Codex usage limits and reset times in the Command Palette Dock.

## Data accessed

The extension accesses the locally installed Codex app-server to request account rate-limit information. If that request is unavailable, it may read local Codex session metadata as a fallback. This data is used only to render the usage indicators on the user's device.

## Data collection and transmission

Codex Usage Dock does not collect, sell, share, or transmit personal information, usage information, or session metadata to the developer or to any developer-operated service. It does not include analytics, advertising, telemetry, or tracking.

Communication initiated by the extension is limited to the local Codex app-server. Codex and any services it communicates with are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

## Data storage

The extension does not create an external user account or remote database. Settings and temporary runtime state remain on the user's Windows device.

## Permissions

The Windows `runFullTrust` capability is required to run the packaged Command Palette COM server and to communicate with the locally installed Codex process. It is not used to bypass Windows security controls or access unrelated user data.
